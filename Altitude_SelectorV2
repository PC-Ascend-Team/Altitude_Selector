  /*// This function is a bit more complicated than the last one I gave you.

    // it's okay to hardcode because these pins won't change during real operations)

    // The delay function could become a problem eventually (delay blocks processing other things until done)
    // This would be an issue if we're worried about checking altitude constantly. A fix could be millis()
